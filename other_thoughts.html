    <h2 id="why-locks" class="indextitle">Why use locking carabiners?</h2>
    <p class="about-page">Carabiners fundamentally connect two or more items. Locking carabiners provide additional security, but security for what purpose?</p>
    
    <h3 class="criteria">1. Retain the connected items</h3>
    <p class="about-page">  The obvious answer - things that are supposed to be attached cannot slip out of an open gate.</p>
    
    <h3 class="criteria">2. Maximize strength</h3>
    <p class="about-page">  A closed gate maximizes the strength of loaded carabiner. Foreign objects such as tree branches, rocks or other equipment may push the gate open.</p>
    <p class="about-page">Additionally, in a hard fall the carabiner can slam quickly against an object. As the carabiner is abruptly stopped, 
      the gate retains enough momentum to momentarily open. In the moment while the gate is open, the carabiner may feel the load generated by the fall, and could break.</p>
    <p class="about-page">This <em>gate&nbsp;flutter</em> phenomenon is a minor concern and unlikely even in lead rock climbing, where hard falls are more commonplace.</p>
    
    <h3 class="criteria">3. Prevent accidental connections</h3>
    <p class="about-page">  If a stationary item such as a tree branch, fixed rope or cable presses against the carabiner gate, it may become clipped on accident - 
      placing the climber in a predicement where they cannot advance or retreat without disconnecting the foreign object or transferring to another system.</p>
      
    <p class="about-page">  But another danger is that the same item is clipped a second time, typically by a rigid item pressing against carabiner gate 
      then sliding off the gate itself, or a flexible good such as a rope being drawn against the gate under tension.</p>
    <p class="about-page">  Either way, an accidental <em>roll-out</em> is incredibly dangerous and most common when attaching carabiners to other rigid hardware.
      This is one reason modern ANSI&nbsp;z359 compliant connectors feature a rated gate-face strength of 16kN, 
      since work-at-height procedures often involve hardware-to-hardware connections.</p>
